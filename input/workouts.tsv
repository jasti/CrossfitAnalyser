20020131	"For time: 50 Push-ups 50 Pull-ups 75 Sit-ups 75 Kettlebell Swings, 1 ""pood"" kettlebell (16kg) 150 Air SquatsPerform in any order. The idea is to perform each in as  few sets as possible. All of the reps from each exercise do not have  to be completed before starting some from another exercise.  Keep track of the reps and tally the total sets to completion.  Note time to completion. Final score is total number of sets  multiplied by time in minutes to completion.Notes:  1. One possible approach is to perform a near max set of push-ups,  go on to the pull-ups, do the same with the sit-ups, etc. After the squats,  go back to the push-ups and run through the list again finishing as much  as you can at each exercise.  2. Seven sets total in ten minutes for a ""70"" is an excellent score! ____________________""Great works are performed not by strength but by perseverance."" - Samuel Johnson We've been here before, but this site is so rich with worthwhile  diet information that we've got to come back:  http://www.panix.com/~paleodiet/"

After a warm-up make your first effort a heroic effort  on the bike and record the distance. Take any rest needed  and give the best dumbbell bench-press you can at fifteen  reps or less. Again, rest as long as you want then repeat  both efforts. Use the same weight for each bench press set. 2.

20030429	50 Glute Ham Sit-ups Tabata “Bottom to Bottom” Squats 50 Abmat Sit-upsThe Tabata Bottom to Bottom Squat is a Tabata Squat but each rep begins at the bottom and ends at the bottom. The turn around at the top is immediate - no pause. The ten-second rest for each interval is also held at the bottom of the squat as opposed to the top. Interestingly, this squat, in contrast to the “normal” Tabata squat, motivates full hip extension. Also, the ten second rests don’t seem as short with this protocol!Life is a succession of moments. To live each one is to succeed.      - Corita KentHere’s an interesting story about the Navy’s reevaluation of the sit-up: http://www.abmat.com/navy1.htm
20030428	Shoulder Press 15 RM X 15 reps 20 Pull-ups Push Press 15 RM X 15 reps 20 Pull-ups Push Jerk 15 RM X 15 reps 20 Pull-upsWork at a pace that allows for max load. Complete each round of pull-ups in as few sets as possible. The load for the presses should increase from the shoulder press to the push press to the push jerk. The progression of these presses is from lesser to greater functionality, max load, metabolic stimulus, and total body involvement.    enlarge imageDave Leys' push jerk a moment before the catch; the hip is dropping, and the bar is rising. Notice his hip is back and his weight is on his heels.
20030427	Complete three rounds for time: Run 400 meters Deadlift bodyweight X 15 reps 24” Box Jump X 20 reps  This workout contains three different functional applications of hip extension. Note the seeming incompatibility of these movements. The benefit here is largely a function of pace or total time – don’t dally!

20030516	Rest Day  Enlarge imageBy selecting the duration of both the work and rest intervals, interval training can be used to focus on each of each of the three metabolic pathways. There are, however, hybrid intervals like the Tabata protocol (20 seconds of work followed by 10 seconds of rest repeated eight times) that have strong anaerobic and aerobic characteristics. Ultimately, you need to experiment with varying intervals of work and rest in pursuit of particularly challenging combinations. Variances in interval work are important to broad adaptation or great fitness.  Dr. Stephen Seiler is a good source on the subject of interval training.

20030508	Rest Day This is our thick handled, rotating pull-up bar. Built by our staff engineer and friend, Nick Massman, this beast will take someone with 30 pull-ups and bring them down to 10 or less. The combination of a two-inch thick bar and bearing mounts wildly increases grip requirements. Just hanging from the bar is a challenge. When your grip tires there’s little warning – boom you’re falling!
20030507	Deadlift 3-3-1-1-1-1-1Go slow and heavy!The late Dr. Robert Atkins was the Louis Pasteur of our times. If you’ll remember from science history Pasteur was ridiculed and vilified by the media and medical community for maintaining that disease was caused by microorganisms that lived all around us. Dr. Atkins suffered similar condemnation for revealing that carbohydrate not dietary fat was the culprit in heart disease. The medical community is rapidly coming around to Atkins’ position and highly acclaimed science writer Gary Taubes brought the world’s attention to this shift in a piece in a July 8th, 2002 article in the New York Times Magazine entitled “What if It’s All Been A Big Fat Lie?” This article had an enormous impact on the public’s awareness of the medical community’s emerging acceptance of Atkins’ position.Reason Magazine published a poorly researched and strongly biased criticism of Taubes’ work by Michael Fumento in March entitled “Big Fat Fake.” Longtime fans of Reason Magazine, the CrossFit staff were sorely disappointed by Mr. Fumento’s piece. Michael Fumento, otherwise, a first rate journalist, has published several articles and a book on nutrition that reveal his ignorance on the subject. Reason recently published a rebuttal by Gary Taubes to Michael Fumento’s criticisms on Reason’s website that hit the mark. Following Taubes' rebuttal is a reply by Fumento.

20030504	Rest DayFred Koch, Robert Blom, and Vidar Jacob made an important contribution to our understanding of abdominal training with their “abmat” work. http://www.abmat.com/intro.htm.Learn, train, and practice the “abmat” style sit-up as well as the “L” sit , glute-ham/Roman Chair sit-up, and hollowrock. Set goals for each of these exercises. On the glute-ham and Roman Chair sit-up learn to lift with the Quads’ rectus femoris as well as the typically dominant psoas. The key to this is to attempt to extend the leg even though it may be nearly fully extended and to lift up sharply on the shin supports. If you have equipment that let’s you adjust the contact pads, move the hip pad away from the hip and towards the knee to encourage more quadriceps use.

Compare your time to August 5, 2003 when we did a ""mini-Diane"" at 15-12-9 reps. It's expected that you'll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management - work/rest timing to optimize time - is an essential skill. If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up, take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk. The point is that there's a manageable substitution for this workout for everyone that preserves both its mechanical and metabolic characteristics - this will be ""your Diane."""

Greece rose to the height of her glory (leaving her indelible mark upon the world) during that period when the physical vigor, the patriotic zeal, the independence and freedom of her people were at their height. Athletic professionalism for the few and a lack of strenuous participation among the many brought about a decline in the national physical stamina and a consequent decline in the power of Greece. The same may be said of the great Roman Empire and of Egypt. History indicates, too, that a decadent nation realizes the costly blunder it has made only after defeat at the hands of a physically superior enemy. A period of reorganization follows and attempts are made to imbue the nation with the need of physical improvement.""   - ""Gymnastics and Tumbling"", Aviation Training Division, Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, US Navy, 1944."

Its expected that youll need to partition the sets, e.g., Deadlift 7-7-7 & Handstand push-up 3-3-3-3-3-3-3 as a first round. Interval management  work/rest timing to optimize time is an essential skill. If the load is too much under any partitioning scheme, reduce it. If you need help with the handstand push-up, take it in any manner you can get it. If the handstand push-up (HSPU) is clearly beyond your current capacity, substitute a standing dumbbell shoulder press (hip and leg free). Though a less functional press, the standing shoulder press is a closer simulation to the HSPU than the more functional push-press or jerk.
